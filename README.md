Because Photobucket disabled 3rd Party Hosting on June 28, 2017 and I'm not going to shell out 400 dollars a year for a service I only use to host forum assets.

This is a repository to host assets I use in forum signatures, project teasers, etc, primarily in regards to the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forum and my own website.

In this repository are two folders: public and private. Please refrain from using or sharing the images in the private folder - these are for my personal use only. Images in the public folder are meant to be shown to the public rather than be used by the public and are meant primarily for forum embedding - game screenshots, etc. for my various scripts and projects.

All of the images in this folder are of my own creation or are of the creation of myself and/or other contributors.
