Because Photobucket disabled 3rd Party Hosting in late June 2017 and I'm not going to shell out 400 dollars a year for a service I only use to host forum assets.

This is a repository to host assets I use in forum signatures, etc, primarily in regards to the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forum.

In this repository are two folders: public and private. Feel free to use any of the images in the public folder for your own use. However, please refrain from using the images in the private folder.

All of the images in this folder are of my own creation.
